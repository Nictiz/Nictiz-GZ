# Nictiz YATC component `YATC-internal/hl7-2-fhir`

Component for transforming HL7 documents into FHIR.

For more information, see the [documentation files](doc/index.md) in its `doc/` subdirectory.

This component is built based on the [general engine](../../YATC-shared/doc/general-engine.md). 

This is a replacement for the original `HL7-mappings/hl7_2_fhir` component.
