# HL7 mappings, ada_2_hl7` mp 6.12

This repository contains executable mappings to convert between ada and MP 6.12. These XSLT transformation are only here for testing purposes, mainly for quality checks of the corresponding hl7_2_ada mapping for MP 6.12.
Since they were only created for internal quality checks, they have not been designed to be used in any real mapping scenario. This folder is only for Nictiz internal purposes.

These mappings are mainly used for demonstration purposes. Nictiz provides no guarantees regarding the accuracy of the transformations.

The XSLT's have been tested with Saxon-HE-9.8.0-15.jar .
