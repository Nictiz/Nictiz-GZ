           This XSL was created to facilitate mapping from ADA xml to wiki table(s)
           
           This single stylesheet replaces the multiple stylesheets ADA2test-wiki-table-mp-rp-medgegs-*.xsl in the
           original Ant based code. It has two additional parameters ($abbreviation and $elementNameId) to take care
           of the differences.
