    <title><anchor name="include-exclude"/>The <elm>include</elm> and <elm>exclude</elm> elements</title>

    <para>The <elm>include</elm> and <elm>exclude</elm> elements define which files will be processed/copied:</para>
    <unorderedlist>
        <entry>
            <para>If there are no <elm>include</elm> elements, all files are included.</para>
        </entry>
        <entry>
            <para>A file is processed/copied when it's included and not excluded.</para>
        </entry>
    </unorderedlist>

    <element name="include">
        <attributes>
            <attribute name="pattern" type="xs:string">
                <para>A regular expression, matched against filenames. For instance <code>\.xml$</code> for all XML files.</para>
            </attribute>
            <attribute name="glob" type="xs:string">
                <para>A (UNIX style) glob matched against filenames. For instance <code>*.xml</code> for all XML files.</para>
            </attribute>
        </attributes>
        <additional-text>Use either @pattern or @glob, not both.</additional-text>
    </element>

    <unorderedlist>
        <entry>
            <para>Matching on patterns or globs is on file<emph>name</emph> only (not on its path).</para>
        </entry>
        <entry>
            <para>Globs can <emph>not</emph> contain character class entries (<code>[…]</code>) and other more sophisticated constructs. Therefore, if your name matching gets complicated, you'll have to use patterns, not globs.</para>
        </entry>
    </unorderedlist>


    <para>The definition of the <elm>exclude</elm> element is identical to that of the <elm>include</elm> element.</para>
