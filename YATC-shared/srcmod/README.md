Directory `YATC-shared/srcmod`

This directory contains building blocks for the data format references, as can be found in `doc` sub-directories of the components.

The documents must validate against `../xsd/text-document.xsd`.

Usually, they are processed (as part of a larger document) by `../xpl/text-documents-2-markdown.xpl` and turned into Markdown.
