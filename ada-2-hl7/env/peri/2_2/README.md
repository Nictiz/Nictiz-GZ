The original `HL7-mappings` application `ada-2-hl7/peri/2_2` contained no executable (Ant or otherwise) code. It did contain the data as is stored here, provenance unclear. Might be important, so that's why it is retained.

Since I have no idea what needs to be done, there is no corresponding `ada-2-hl7/peri/2_2` application defined!
