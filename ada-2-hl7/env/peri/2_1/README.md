# Subdirectory `YATC-internal/ada-2-hl7/env/peri/2_1/`

The original `HL7-mappings` application `ada-2-hl7/peri/2_1` contained no executable (Ant or otherwise) code nor data, just this single stylesheet. Might be important, so that's why it is retained here.

Since I have no idea what needs to be done, there is no corresponding `ada-2-hl7/peri/2_1` application defined!
